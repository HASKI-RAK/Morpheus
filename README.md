# Morpheus

## Name
Morpheus - data generator for realisitic learner profiles.

## Description
Similar to "Morpheus" - the Greek god who could craft realisitic visions - our data generator creates realisitc learner profiles like learner characteristics, learming paths which helps education researchers with rapid prototyping data-driven models, and also verify, validate and aanalyze software models.

### Overview
Morpheus is a synthetic data generator designed to create realistic learner profiles, including learner characteristics, learning paths, and more. Inspired by the Greek god Morpheus, who could craft realistic visions, this tool helps education researchers rapidly prototype data-driven models, verify and validate software models, and analyze various educational algorithms.

Data is the foundation of all machine learning applications, and generating high-quality learner data is especially challenging due to the difficulty in collecting diverse and unbiased samples. Morpheus addresses these challenges by utilizing probabilistic models like Bayesian Networks, Hidden Markov Models, and Markov Chains to synthesize complex learner profiles.

### Key Features:
Generate synthetic learner profiles based on real-world data collected from 593 students across several semesters.
Supports modeling of learning styles, strategies, personalities, and preferred learning paths.
Incorporates Bayesian Information Criterion and cross-validation to select the best models for data generation.
Provides simulation modules for user-defined learner profile creation.
Open-source and customizable for specific educational research needs.

## Installation and Usage
To install and run Morpheus, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/morpheus.git
```

Install the required dependencies:
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the main script:
``` bash
python3 main.py --config.py
```


For training the models with your own data:
For learner characteristics:
``` bash
cd source\synthesizer\LChars\train\
python3 bn.py --path "path_to_custom_inputdata" --output_filename "name_to_save_trainedmodel" 
``` 
For learning paths:
``` bash
cd source\synthesizer\LPaths\train\
python3 learn_transition_probs.py --path "path_to_custom_inputdata" --output_filename "name_to_save_trainedmodel" --target_lstyle "sample_learningstyle"
```

For running the GUI and generating data:
``` bash
cd morpheus
python3 gui.py
```
